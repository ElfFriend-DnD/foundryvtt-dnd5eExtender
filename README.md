Theoretically, this module provides a placable reusable "component" which details all of the actions a given Character Actor can take.

## Warnings

This can seriously fuck up your game. If you're planning on running a game with alternative ability scores or skills, do not add and remove them repeatedly. This is intended to be a one-time set and forget modification. After you've set an ability score, removing it carries some risks.

### Compatibility

I'm honestly not sure how well this will play with modules that affect character sheets, I'll try to test as many as possible but if something is obviously breaking please create and issue here and I'll see what I can do.
